    "## Main graphing function\n",
    "\n",
    "The code-block below contains the main functions for generating the desired graphs based on the STIX data.\\\n",
    "The following main functions are present in the code block below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate_relationships --> gets all relationships which are deemed relevant (add more if required)\n",
    "- Generate network --> Main graph generation function\n",
    "  - get_nodes --> simple helper function which gets all nodes from a specific type such as intrusion-set, attack-pattern, etc.\n",
    "  - generate_nodes --> Helper function that actually creates the nodes and adds them to the graph\n",
    "  - Generate edges --> Helper function to get all edges based in the node_types which are parsed to the method\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To genetate a new graph, call the generate `generate_network`, the only required positional argument is a name for the graph to be stored which needs to be a string.\\\n",
    "However this will generate and empty graph, so as to actually generate a graph with node please specify the node types to generate by setting the relevant booleans in the method call.\\\n",
    "Additionally there is an option to set the height of the generated graph, it is recommended to take a height greater that 1200 pixels as the graph is quite tall. \\\n",
    "The corresponding width is automagically generated with a 21:9 ratio. \\\n",
    "The function returns the generated graph after saving the visualization to a file, this is for further processing later so ensure to assign the method to a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "There are some limitations with the functions as there are some relations which require other nodes, that they are sometimes generated as they are in an edge definition but not added as a node.\n",
    "Additionally when gettting the initial set of relations, all (relevant) relations are collected.\\\n",
    "This was partly to ensure that no data was missing in the dataset, however it is not fully efficient.\\\n",
    "However, as this notebook will likely see limited use only, this is something that is taken for granted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is currently no data_source mapping as it is an embedded relationship for the detections, however that may require more re-work of the code that is currently worth it."
